# Backend API Design for LIFTLY

## Overview
This document outlines the design and initial API endpoint definitions for the backend of the LIFTLY app, which supports user management, booking and task management, payment processing, membership subscriptions, and notifications.

## 1. User Management
- User registration and authentication (Firebase Auth integration)
- User roles: client, driver, partner
- Profile management for clients and workers

## 2. Booking and Task Management
- Clients create, update, cancel bookings
- Workers view and accept assigned tasks
- Task status tracking (pending, in-progress, completed)

## 3. Payment Processing
- Stripe integration for client payments and worker payouts
- Store payment history and transaction records
- Calculate worker earnings based on completed tasks

## 4. Membership and Subscription
- Manage client subscriptions and membership tiers
- Subscription billing and renewal handling

## 5. Notifications
- Push notifications for task assignments, booking updates (Firebase Cloud Messaging)

## Security
- All endpoints require authentication via Firebase tokens
- Role-based access control enforced on sensitive endpoints

## Next Steps
- Implement authentication middleware
- Develop user management endpoints
- Integrate Stripe payment processing
- Build booking and task management logic
- Setup Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications
